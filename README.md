# sbcc_gclasscal
Replacement for Luminis 5 class calendar updates. 


Purpose of this code is to replicate functionality of my College's portal. It is intended to be a working kludge till a better solution
for our instructors such as standardising on Canvas.

My intent for putting this software up on Github is to have 
a repository, example of my work. Also, finding documentation on
how to do this type of programming is sparce at best.

It is licensed under MIT. I had origionally tried unlicense, but there is a feeling that it is not the best option and no license file is the same as a restrictive license.
